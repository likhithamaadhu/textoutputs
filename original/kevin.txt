you know rather than be scared by a
jobless future I started to rethink it and I said I could really be excited by
a jobless future because I can finally see a day in under 50 years when people
don't have to work for pay because humans have labored for thousands of
years slaves - they're primarily in most of the world and soon they'll be able to
do what they wanted to do what they were born to do before someone came along and
said stop doing that you got to go order to living this is a whole new
Renaissance that we may be able to see actually in our lifetime where humans
can can can do what they were born to do like art and dance and music and
invention and caring for others and whatever it is that you want to do now
that will be fits and starts there'll be politics that get in the way
this is no yuto no it is a utopia actually come to think of it and working
together towards this goal this is actually a great idea when we look at it
from this vantage point
