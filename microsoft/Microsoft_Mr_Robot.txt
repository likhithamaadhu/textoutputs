The system, but since there are no other solutions, he agrees to it. The next morning, Gideon and Elliot fly to their data center and begin the recovery. First, Elliot redirects traffic to another server and then reboots the situation. The plan works and the servers are finally out of danger. Later, when Elliot is going through the encrypted files, he notices something strange. He finds a text file named F Society that says leave me here. Elliot realizes that the file was meant to be found by him, so he decides against deleting it. Instead, he hides it inside Evilcorp server so that only he can access it later in the next scene, as Elliot is returning home via the subway, a strange man named Mr. Rob. Approaches him. He asks Elliot to exit the train and meet him outside for a chat, but only if he hasn't deleted the text file. Hearing this, Elliot realizes that Mr. Robot is from F society, the same organization that attacked Evil Corp server. Hence he quickly exits the train and follows the man. After a bit of small talk, Mr. Robot takes Elliot to their workplace on Coney Island, which apparently is a basement. Groom with several computers. Unlike other hacking organizations, Mr. Robot reveals. That here everyone has to meet physically and do things together. Elliot says screw. You, man. Do you know how many places offer work from home?

The next day at work, Elliott, his colleagues, the FBI, and the executives from Evil Corp are having a meeting about the cyber attack. Angela is doing her best to brief the situation, but the arrogant Colby ignores her and tells her to leave the meeting. This enrages Elliot, so he eventually decides to. The file over to the FBI after the incident several days passed by, but the news of Colby's arrest has not appeared. Moreover, Mr. Robot and his GF society have become anonymous, prompting Elliott to believe that he was tricked with nothing else to do. He decides to toy with Trisha's boyfriend Michael. He calls him, pretending to be his bank officer, and extracts important details like his dog's name. Favorite things and so on. Using the information he easily hacks into Michael's accounts and learns that he is cheating on Trisha with several women, some of whom are under. Aged that night, Elliot confronts Michael and reveals that he knows everything. He then blackmails him to come clean with Trisha, or else he will inform the police left with no choice.

Surprisingly, the new CEO of Evil Corp doesn't. Even use two step. Authentication and Elliot easily gets access to his emails. He scrolls through it but finds nothing other than family photos. This is when it strikes Elliot that Tyrell wanted him to hack his database all along, hence he disconnects his computer, turns off the router and burns the memory cards to stay anonymous the next day at work, Gideon summons Elliot to his office and displays a recent video released by the Cyber hacking. Group F Society in the video an anonymous person in the mask takes responsibility for the recent attack on Evil Corp and demands the release of Colby. That threatens the major credit organizations to dissolve their assets and to distribute them evenly among charity organizations. Failure to comply will result in these major organizations getting hacked. Seeing the video, Elliott once again assumes that he has been duped. Later, he returns home, distraught only to find someone in his shower. It is Darlene, one of the F Society hackers. He had met earlier. She has come to escort him to their hideout for the next mission. Elliot believes that he is going against the law and fears being caught, but suddenly he realizes that he can.

However, in the subway, he realizes that he cannot run. Away from society as he has also become one of them. All these incidents have started to take a toll on Elliott's psyche, so he decides to increase his morphine dosage. He goes to his neighbor, Slash drug dealer Sheila's house, only to find a violent woman abuser and drug supplier named Fernando. Now it appears to know everything about him as he is Sheila's only drug dealer who often visits her. He is the one who supplies the morphine that Elliot regularly consumes. This is also the reason why Elliot doesn't expose him to the police. If Fernando is gone, his morphine is also gone. Shortly after Fernando leaves and Elliot finds Sheila half unconscious and beaten up in the bathroom, he urges her to inform the police about the constant abuse she has been suffering, but Sheila refuses, saying Fernando provides her with very good deals. This infuriates Elliott, so he decides to take matters into his own hands. He anonymously leaks Fernando's details to the police.

They talk about their past lives and families, but in the midst of it. Mr. Robot expresses his. Pleasure due to the fact that Elliot abandoned them some days ago, saying this, he suddenly chucks Elliot from the railing and onto the rocky beach below. On the other hand, the interim CEO of Evil Corp Tyrell gives an inspiring speech to the CEO, explaining why his role should be made permanent, but to his dismay the CEO reveals that they have found a good candidate whom they want to try out first. Hearing this, Tyrell becomes enraged and heads to an isolated location. There he meets a homeless man, pays him some cash, and beats him to a pulp to vent his frustration. The men in this show are more twisted than the Targaryens. Meanwhile, Elliot wakes up in a hospital, bruised and bandaged. He is visited by his therapist Krista, who believes that he overdosed on morphine and fell from the railing. When Elliot denies this, she asked him to provide her with a blood sample. This is music to Elliott's ears because the current hospital he is in has a very weak security system. It is run on Windows 98. And has a puny antivirus as protection. As a result, he easily hacks into it and alters his records to make it look like his blood is free of drugs after. And discharged Elliott heads to work the next day, where Mr. Robot pays him a surprise visit. The two then head to a bar to discuss, but Elliot is still angry about what happened earlier. He tells Mr. Robot that he doesn't want to be a part of his plan anymore and asks him to be left alone.

Several people due to leukemia, including Elliott's dad and Angela's mom. The news makes Elliott Sad, but now he has a purpose to take down the company.

Taking this is the perfect opportunity. All he finally reveals that someone has hacked into his computer. The hacker Cisco has sent several nude pictures of Angela along with credit card details of her father, and is threatening to release them. However, all he can stop that from happening. If he infects their workplace, all safe. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the couple seriously considers doing it in the final scene.
